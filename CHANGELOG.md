# Changelog

Notable changes to Chay's Photo Studio. Versions follow semantic versioning.

## 1.1.1

- Performance: path and selection tools (Pen, lassos, marquees, crop, measure) now repaint their previews on the overlay canvas only — dragging no longer recomposites the whole document, keeping the GUI responsive on large photos.
- Performance: panning and zooming (Hand tool, Navigator drag, zoom controls) re-blit the cached composite instead of recompositing, and selection changes no longer trigger full recomposites.
- Performance: the histogram panel samples a downscaled proxy of the composite instead of reading the full-resolution image.
- Images in dialogs no longer start native browser ghost-drags when clicked or dragged.
- AI Generate results can now be dragged from the dialog straight onto the canvas — the image is placed as a layer centered on the drop point.

## 1.1.0

- AI image generation now defaults to the free Pollinations engine (no account or key) with automatic retries; custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints work as before.
- Object detection now runs fully on-device (saliency + region analysis) — images never leave the browser.
- AI Upscale consolidated into the on-device precision engine (denoise → Lanczos-3 → edge-adaptive detail recovery).
- Every push to the default branch now builds all bundles (Electron installers, webview shells, browser plugin, web bundle) and publishes a GitHub Release automatically; `v*.*.*` tags publish stable releases.
- Fixed CI failing on fresh checkouts (Prisma client generation).
- Desktop installers: the packaged app is now named "Chays Photo Studio" (installer tooling rejects apostrophes in package paths); the app window keeps the full branded title.
- Added package metadata (description, author, homepage) required by Linux package builds.
